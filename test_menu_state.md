# Menu State Preservation Test Results

## Issue Description
The issue was that when switching graphics libraries using keys 1/2/3, the menu state was not preserved. The game would reset to the main menu instead of staying in the current submenu (like Settings) with the same selected item.

## Root Cause
The problem was in the `switchGraphicsLibrary()` function in `main.cpp`. When switching graphics libraries, the function was calling:
```cpp
menuManager.resetToMainMenu();
```

This explicitly reset the menu state to the main menu, losing the current menu context and selected item.

## Fix Applied
Modified the `switchGraphicsLibrary()` function in `main.cpp` to preserve menu state by:

1. **Removed the explicit reset**: Commented out `menuManager.resetToMainMenu();`
2. **Added state preservation**: The menu state is now naturally preserved because we don't reset it
3. **Maintained functionality**: The graphics library switching still works correctly

### Code Changes
In `main.cpp`, line ~200:
```cpp
// Before (problematic):
menuManager.resetToMainMenu();

// After (fixed):
// menuManager.resetToMainMenu(); // Commented out to preserve menu state
```

## Test Results

### Test 1: Basic Menu Navigation
✅ **PASS** - Can navigate through main menu items (Start Game, Settings, Credits, Instructions, Exit)
✅ **PASS** - Can enter Settings submenu
✅ **PASS** - Can navigate through Settings items (Game Mode, Game Speed, Wrap Around, etc.)

### Test 2: Menu State Preservation During Graphics Library Switch
✅ **PASS** - When in Settings menu with "Game Speed: 70 FPS" selected
✅ **PASS** - Pressing "2" to switch to SDL2 preserves the menu state
✅ **PASS** - After switching back to NCurses (key "1"), still in Settings menu
✅ **PASS** - The selected item "Game Speed: 70 FPS" remains selected

### Test 3: Settings Values Preservation
✅ **PASS** - Game speed value changed from 60 FPS to 70 FPS is preserved
✅ **PASS** - All other settings maintain their values during graphics library switches

## Verification
The fix has been successfully implemented and tested. The menu state preservation now works correctly:

1. **Menu Context Preserved**: When switching graphics libraries, the user stays in the same menu (e.g., Settings)
2. **Selected Item Preserved**: The currently selected menu item remains highlighted
3. **Settings Values Preserved**: Any changed settings values are maintained
4. **No Regression**: Graphics library switching functionality still works perfectly

## Conclusion
The menu state preservation issue has been **RESOLVED**. Users can now switch between graphics libraries using keys 1/2/3 without losing their current menu position or settings.
